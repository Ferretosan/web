(Hello!)

## Happy new years!

Yup, it's the new year once again! The cycle shall continue. I hope everyone reading has had a great Christmas (I actually took the ornaments off the tree just then) and has set (achievable) goals for the 2027th year since AD 0.

## Comments coming soon

I'm finally adding comments to my blog post. I don't exactly when these comments will come out (I'm *still* sorting out the server stuff, as I have been for the past forever), but I assure you they will come at some point. Unless the Earth ends. Or I die. Or Bitwarden goes oof. That would suck.

## I don't know what else to put here

Cuz idk what major things are happening, heres some minor things. I have another new subservice, 2factor - a TOTP generator (in beta). And while adding it today I forgot to change the version number, sorry guys! More words to this thing to fill up space.

じゃあね
(Bye!)
