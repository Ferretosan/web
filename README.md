# Patch Notes

## How patch notes work

* The first number (x.y.y - x is the number) is the website's **major release**. This basically is each time the website drastically chanegs, like whole new `style.css`, layouts, etc. Currently we're on version 7!
* The second number (y.x.y) is the minor release. This is where I make a change that is noticable, but not changing the whole thing. This could be like a background change or even just working on the website with different goals, etc. I'm not bothering to put the latest minor release in here as it is quite fickle.
* The third number (y.y.x) is the patch release. This number goes up every time I make a new version of the website. Like a minor `style.css` change or adding some stuffs, idk I forgot what I was going to write here!
